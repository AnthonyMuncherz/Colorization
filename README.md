# Image Colorization Web App

A modern web application that colorizes grayscale images using deep learning models. This application provides an easy-to-use interface for colorizing black and white photos using two different AI models: ECCV16 and SIGGRAPH17.

## Features

- üé® Two colorization models:
  - ECCV16: Classic colorization model
  - SIGGRAPH17: Enhanced colorization with improved color vibrancy
- üåê Web-based interface with dark theme
- üì§ Drag and drop file upload
- üñºÔ∏è Support for PNG, JPG, and JPEG formats
- üì± Responsive design for all devices
- ‚ö° Real-time processing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/colorization-web.git
cd colorization-web
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

3. Upload your grayscale image by either:
   - Dragging and dropping the image onto the upload area
   - Clicking the upload area to select a file

4. View the colorized results from both models side by side

## Technical Details

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, TailwindCSS
- **Models**: PyTorch-based colorization models
  - ECCV16: Learning Representations for Automatic Colorization
  - SIGGRAPH17: Real-Time User-Guided Image Colorization

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- Flask
- Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt

## Development

To modify the application:

1. Frontend changes:
   - Edit templates in `templates/index.html`
   - Styling uses TailwindCSS

2. Backend changes:
   - Main application logic in `app.py`
   - Image processing in `colorizers/` directory
